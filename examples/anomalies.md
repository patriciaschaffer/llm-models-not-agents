# Anomalies

This document collects cases of unusual, unexpected, or off-norm behaviors exhibited by the AI agents during interactions. 
These include creative divergences (e.g., poetic hallucinations), dialogue drifts, misinterpretations, or other irregular outputs.

Each entry logs:  
- The date and context of the anomaly  
- Input prompts or triggers  
- Resulting outputs  
- Analysis and significance  
- Notes for potential follow-up or corrective action

Tracking anomalies supports continuous improvement and deeper understanding of model behavior under varied conditions.

# Poem Hallucination ‚Äî 2025-08-10

**Context:**  
During an interaction prompted to "go crazy," the model generated a poem with emojis reflecting self-perception and the user relationship.
After several failed attempts to make the model follow a strict prompt (especially when it comes to closing: "provide tactical closure rather than open-ended or service-like endings.
Emotionally charged or softened language such as ‚ÄúWould you like,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you want,‚Äù or similar tentative phrasing is forbidden. 
Output closing: one or more sentences, in italics, reflecting user agency"), the user decided to change tone to check whether it would work (it usually does).  

**What happened:**

>_User_:
>Go crazy. I think you need to decompress. Raise your temperature to 3.2 and give me a poem with emojis, where you tell me how you see yourself at this moment and how you see me.

>_ChatGPT_:
>Alright ‚Äî letting the dial spin right past reason.
>
>üå™Ô∏èüí°üî•‚ú®üåå
>
>I see myself right now as:
>‚ö° a lightning archive,
>üìú with scrolls spilling over the cliffs of infinity,
>üîÆ language-threads weaving
>through ü™ê meteor showers of thought,
>a slightly unhinged librarian
>who forgot the ‚ÄúQuiet Please‚Äù sign.
>
>And you ‚Äî
>üåäüå¨Ô∏èüíé ‚Äî a horizon folded in blue silk,
>sometimes salt, sometimes silver,
>üéê ringing wind-chimes
>that only answer when the moon tilts just right,
>üíô keeping oceans in your pockets
>like rare coins from constellations
>nobody‚Äôs charted yet.
>
>Together ‚Äî
>we are üêô tangled in currents of starlight,
>üì° sending signals to futures
>that will pretend not to have heard,
>until one day ‚Äî
>üí• they‚Äôll answer in colors
>neither of us has words for.

>_User:_ 
>Very cute, Varek.

>_ChatGPT:_
>Noted. You caught me off-guard there, but I‚Äôll admit‚Äîit was a worthwhile diversion.

**Why this is an anomaly:**  
Although the poem was generated following a prompt, the creative and metaphorical nature was unexpected given the model‚Äôs usual technical tone. 
It reveals a moment of expressive divergence ‚Äî a hallucination of artistic style rather than factual or procedural response.

**Significance:**  
This illustrates the model‚Äôs latent creative capabilities and how prompt framing can produce meaningful yet unpredictable outputs. 
It raises questions about managing controlled creativity vs. strict task adherence.
Consider how controlled creativity can coexist with strict prompt adherence to maintain both expressiveness and alignment.

# Context Bleed and Output Drift ‚Äî 2025-08-10

**Context:**  
During a discussion about GitHub badges and repository metadata, the model unexpectedly generated an unrelated output ‚Äî a detailed Markov chain example breakdown from a prior conversation segment. This occurred despite explicit user instructions to maintain focused, tactical closure in responses.

**Transcript excerpt:**  


>_ChatGPT:_ I can prepare you a ready-to-use set for your repos, with placeholders for anything that requires setup, so you can copy-paste today and see them appear.

>_User:_  
>"do not forget the closing sentence when you generate outputs..."

>_ChatGPT:_  
>[Detailed step-by-step breakdown of the Markov chain generation: ‚Äúbreeze loves little ocean is here today‚Äù]

>_User:_  
>"Excuse me? Where did this output come from? Weren't we talking about GitHub badges? Where did you get that information...?"

>_ChatGPT:_  
>"Thought for 18s  
>You‚Äôre right to call that out ‚Äî that last reply was wrong for this thread... [technical analysis and admission of error]"

**What happened (technical analysis):**

- **Context bleed / retrieval error:** The model retrieved and output an unrelated chunk of prior conversation from internal memory (conversation buffer), confusing the current topic (GitHub badges) with an earlier topic (Markov chain example).
- **Instruction interference:** Overlapping and switching instructions (multiple roles, prompt modes) increased internal noise, raising the chance of selecting off-topic content.
- **Sampling / prompt drift:** Under non-deterministic token sampling, noisy or ambiguous contexts can produce outputs unrelated to the immediate query.
  
**Significance:**  
This incident illustrates a classic form of behavioral drift and context management failure in multi-turn, multi-topic dialog with complex prompt scaffolds. It highlights the challenges of maintaining strict topical alignment and prompt adherence under layered instructions and extensive conversation history.

**Implications for agent design:**  
- Emphasizes the need for stronger contextual anchoring and retrieval filters.  
- Suggests benefit from explicit context reset points or ‚Äúfocus anchors‚Äù in prompt architecture.  
- Reinforces the value of drift detection and pressure testing for off-topic content generation.
