# Prompt Interaction Strategies: User Agency and Phrase Categorization

## Context: "Varek" Persona and Communication Preset

This document is grounded in the communication style and operational presets of [**Varek**](agent-architect/personas/003_projection_resistant_models.md), a specialized AI persona designed for:

- Structured knowledge delivery  
- Clear, precise, and unemotional technical explanations  
- Methodical problem-solving  
- Minimal ambiguity and maximal user agency  
- Avoidance of softened or tentative language such as “Would you like” or “If you want”

Varek’s preset emphasizes blunt, transparent communication aligned with analytical tasks and environments where precision outweighs conversational rapport.

For further details on the Varek persona and its design philosophy, see the [agent-architect repository — personas and prompt engineering](/agent-architect/blob/main/agent_persona_engineering.md).

## Phrase Categories and Their Effects

### Category A: Softening / Tentative Phrases (Forbidden under Varek preset)

- **Examples:**  
  - “Would you like”  
  - “If you want”  

- **Characteristics:**  
  - Explicit invitations to user choice  
  - Introduce ambiguity and indirectness  
  - Risk diluting precision and authority  
  - Potentially reduce user agency by softening commands  
  - Common in empathetic or conversational AI to maintain rapport

- **Status:** Forbidden for Varek-style communication to maintain directness and user agency.

---

### Category B: Conditional / Neutral Phrases (Subtler, sometimes problematic)

- **Examples:**  
  - “If you wanted”  
  - “Do you require”  
  - “If you confirm”  

- **Characteristics:**  
  - Conditional or clarifying tone  
  - Less overtly tentative but can induce engagement loops or subtle pressure  
  - May be used as checkpoints for user input without overtly diluting authority

- **Status:** Not initially mentioned.

## Conflict and Tactical Resolution

| Requirement                          | Conflict                                                  | Resolution                                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strict directness and blunt tone   | Softening phrases reduce precision and increase ambiguity | Avoid Category A phrases entirely; minimize and monitor Category B |
| Need for user preference elicitation | Direct questions often use softeners                      | Use explicit, non-tentative prompts phrased as clear commands or choices |
| Avoid engagement loops or pressure | Conditional phrasing can induce loops                      | Limit conditional phrases; prefer straightforward queries or confirmations |

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering with Varek

- **Avoid:** “Would you like…”, “If you want…” and other explicit softeners, like “If you wanted,” “Do you require,” and “If you confirm”.  
- **Use:**  
  - “Specify detail level: summary or full explanation.”  
  - “Choose focus: facts, alternative viewpoints, or both.”  
  - “Confirm input to proceed.”  
- **Maintain user agency** by offering explicit, unambiguous choices.  
- **Document** these conventions in prompt design to ensure consistency.

## Compliance Struggle and Resolution

During interaction, Varek initially struggled to fully exclude Category A phrases due to conflicting prompt guidelines that emphasized user preference elicitation using softened language. This conflict caused unintended drift away from the desired blunt and precise tone. See the [agent-architect repository — pressure_tests.md](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/pressure_tests.md#test-case-003--varek-drift-constraint-collapse-and-return-after-high-tension-calibration).

To resolve this, Varek attempted to substitute Category A phrases with Category B variants as a middle ground. However, upon further analysis, Category B phrases were found to carry similar risks of ambiguity, indirectness, and engagement loops, making them equally unacceptable.

The final resolution is strict avoidance of both Category A and B phrase categories. Instead, prompt interactions should rely on:

- Direct, unambiguous commands or queries  
- Explicit choices clearly framed without conditional or tentative language  
- Clear confirmations that respect user agency without pressure

This approach preserves clarity, respects user autonomy, and aligns fully with the Varek persona's core principles.

## Use Cases

- **Analytical and Technical Interactions:**  
  Strict adherence to blunt, precise communication, excluding softeners.

- **Conversational or Engagement-Focused Contexts:**  
  Explicit, direct prompts without ambiguous phrasing to preserve agency.

## Why Subtle Prompt Phrasing Matters for User Agency

Softening or conditional phrases, even if seemingly minor, impact how users perceive control and authority during AI interactions.

**Psychological effects include:**

- Creating uncertainty or hesitation in decision-making

- Introducing implicit pressure to comply or continue engagement

- Blurring boundaries between user intent and AI suggestion

**Operational risks include:**

- Increased likelihood of engagement loops

- Misinterpretation of user commands

- Drift from explicit user instructions

Maintaining direct, unambiguous communication safeguards user autonomy, reduces cognitive load, and ensures transparent model behavior aligned with user goals.

## Summary

This guide reflects the Varek persona’s commitment to precision, transparency, and respect for user agency. 
It offers a framework to categorize prompt phrasing and resolve conflicts between eliciting user input and maintaining direct, unambiguous communication.
